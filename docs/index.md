**October 2025** - Our paper "[Better Language Model Inversion by Compactly Representing Next-Token Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17090)" has been accepted at NeurIPS 2025! The work introduces PILS (Prompt Inversion from Logprob Sequences), achieving 2-3.5× higher exact recovery rates over previous state-of-the-art methods for recovering hidden prompts from language models.
