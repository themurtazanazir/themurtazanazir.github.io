<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The whole field of linear algebra, as the name suggests, is based on linear combinations of different “things”. We will get to know what these “things” are. How can we represent the different combinations and what these different combinations represent, if they represent anything. We will basically work with vectors and then with matrices. So let’s begin.</p>

<h2 id="vectors">Vectors</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>A vector is, simply put, a data holding structure. It can hold entries of data. We can store values of a specific feature in a vector. We can store coordinates of any point in a n-dimensional space.</p>

<p>The specific function of a vector holding coordinates of a point is used the most. The same data can represent an arrow from origin to the point stored in the vector(the definition physicists usually identify vectors by).</p>

<p>So a vector can represent just <script type="math/tex">n</script> numbers(data), Arrow from origin, or a point in a space. The vector is said to be <script type="math/tex">n</script>-dimensional.</p>

<h3 id="representation-of-a-vector">Representation of a Vector</h3>

<p>How do we represent vectors? There are basically two ways to do it. A column vector and a row vector. In a column vector, we stack all the numbers in a single vertical fashion and in a row vector, we stack them in horizontal fashion. While both are fine and can be converted from one form to another, the column vector is conventionally used.</p>

<p>e.g: a vector containing 2 and 3 is represented as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>This vector corresponds to point <script type="math/tex">(2,3)</script>.</p>

<p>A column vector(or a row vector) can also be represented by paranthesis. So the above vector can also be <script type="math/tex">(2,3)</script>. It does not mean it is a row vector. It is actually a column vector(in this case), because we were using column vector. It is just easier to write it.</p>

<p>A 3-dimensional column vector <script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} x  \\ y  \\ z \end{bmatrix}</script> can also be written as <script type="math/tex">( x,y,z)</script> and it sill is column vector. A row vector will be <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} x & y & z \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>.</p>

<p>For now we will primarily represent vectors as columns, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<p>We can do it in a simple way in julia.</p>

<h3 id="operations-on-vectors">Operations on Vectors</h3>

<p>In linear algebra, we work with two important operations, <strong>multiplication by a scalar</strong> and <strong>addition</strong>.</p>

<p>When we multiply a vector by a scalar, all the values in the vector (called the <em>components</em>) are multiplied by the same number.</p>

<p>e.g:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">c\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ 2c \\ 3c\end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>We can add two vectors if their dimensions are same. The resultant vector is the vector of corresponding sums of components of two vectors.</p>

<p>e.g:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\2 \\3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\7\\8\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 9 \\11 \end{bmatrix}</script>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are familiar with vectors from basic physics, you know the addition of two vectors is the third side of a triangle formed by placing the tail of one vector at the head of the other vector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we combine the above two operations on any number of vectors, i.e we multiply each vector by a scalar and then add all the vectors, we get a <strong>linear combination</strong> of those vectors.</p>

<p>So for any two vectors, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{w}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v}</script>, a linear combination is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">c \mathbf{w} + d\mathbf{v}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">c,d</script> are scalars.</p>

<p>for any <script type="math/tex">n</script> vectors, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v}_1,\mathbf{v}_2,\dots</script> a linear combination will be:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">c_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{v}_2 + \cdots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n</script>

<p>We will talk about what all these linear combinations for all <script type="math/tex">c</script> and <script type="math/tex">d</script> represent, later.</p>

<p>Example in julia for three vectors with scalars being 2,3,-1.</p>

<p>Besides the two important operations in linear algebra, we can do other operations on vectors.</p>

<p><strong>Dot Product:</strong> We can multiply two vectors to get a scalar. It is called a dot product. It can occur between two vectors of same dimensions. We just multiply the corresponding elements of the two vectors and sum up the products.</p>

<p>e.g:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5\end{bmatrix} = (1)(4)+(2)(5) = 14</script>

<p>We can achive this in julia as:</p>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="n">LinearAlgebra</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">v1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="x">,</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="x">);</span>
<span class="n">v2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="x">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="x">);</span>

<span class="n">dot</span><span class="x">(</span><span class="n">v1</span><span class="x">,</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="x">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>14
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It can be also calculated as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{v_1} \cdot \mathbf{v2} = \mathbf{v_1}^T \mathbf{v2}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v_1}^T \mathbf{v2}</script> is also called the <strong>inner product</strong> and the <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v_1} \mathbf{v2}^T</script> is called the <strong>outer product</strong>. The outer product produces a matrix.</p>

<p>For two vectors, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{w}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v}</script>, the dot product is also calculated as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert \lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert \cos \theta</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert</script> is the length of vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script> and <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> is the angle between the two vectors.</p>

<p>Because of the cosine, the dot prouct of perpendicular vectors is zero. Also dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of its length.</p>

<p>Since <script type="math/tex">\cos \theta \leq 1</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lvert \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{v} \rvert \leq \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert \lVert \mathbf{v} \rVert</script>

<p>It is the Cauchy-Schwarz-Buniakowsky inequality.</p>

<h2 id="matrices">Matrices</h2>

<p>As we have established, we save data in vectors. Now we work with multiple vectors (for their linear combinations of course!). We will save multiple vectors in a matrix. Let’s do some examples.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have three vectors:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{u} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\0\end{bmatrix} \quad ; \quad \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\-1\end{bmatrix} \quad ;\quad \mathbf{w} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\1\end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>Their linear combination, <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> for scalars <script type="math/tex">c_1</script>, <script type="math/tex">c_2</script> and <script type="math/tex">c_3</script>  is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{b} = c_1\mathbf{u} + c_2 \mathbf{v} + c_3 \mathbf{w} = c_1\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \\0\end{bmatrix} + c_2 \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\-1\end{bmatrix} + c_3 \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 - c_1 \\ c_3- c_2 \end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>Now if we use all our vectors as columns of a matrix, <script type="math/tex">A</script>, that matrix multiplies the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c} = (c_1,c_2,c_3)</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A\mathbf{c} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}c_1\\ c_2 \\ c_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 - c_1 \\ c_3- c_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{b} %]]></script>

<p>Now instead of being just numbers, <script type="math/tex">c_1,c_2,c_3</script> are now also forming a vector. This gives a new view-point to look at it. The output vector, <script type="math/tex">A\mathbf{c}</script>(or <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>) is a combination of the <strong>columns</strong> of <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>

<p>It can also be thought as the matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> above, acts on the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script> and transforms into vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>. This specific matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> above is a <strong>“difference matrix”</strong> because <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> contains differences of vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script>. The vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script> is the input and the output is <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>. The top difference is <script type="math/tex">c_1-c_0 = c_1 -0</script></p>

<h2 id="linear-equations">Linear Equations</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-2">Introduction</h3>

<p>Let’s change the view again. Upto now, the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script> was known. The right hand side <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> was unknown. Now we think of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> as known and look for <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script>.</p>

<p>We were earlier asking to compute the linear combination of <script type="math/tex">c_1\mathbf{u} + c_2 \mathbf{v} + c_3 \mathbf{w}</script> to find <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>. Now we are asking which combination of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{u,v,w}</script> produces a particular vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>?</p>

<p>From now on we will call the unknown vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script> instead of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{c}</script>, because duh!.</p>

<p>This problem is the <strong>inverse problem</strong> i.e to find the input vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script> that gives the desired output <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}= A\mathbf{x}</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Equations:</strong>
For our previous matrix, <script type="math/tex">A</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\\ \implies \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Equations</th>
      <th>Solutions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">x_1 = b_1</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">x_1 = b_1</script></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">-x_1 +x_2 = b_2</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">x_2 = b_1 + b_2</script></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">-x_2 +x_3 = b_3</script></td>
      <td><script type="math/tex">x_3 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3</script></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>So the solution vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script>, for the above equation is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}\mathbf{x} &= \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_1 + b_2 \\ b_1 + b_2 + b_3 \end{bmatrix} \\ &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix}\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Now let’s compare the effects on this vector with <script type="math/tex">A</script>. <script type="math/tex">A</script> acted on a vector and gave the “differences” of the vector elements and this new matrix gives the “sums” of the elements of the vector it acts on. The new matrix is the inverse of the original <script type="math/tex">A</script> and is shown as <script type="math/tex">A^{-1}</script>.</p>

<p>So if,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align} A\mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{b} \\ \implies \mathbf{x} &= A^{-1}\mathbf{b}\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>This was the solution for this problem because the matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> was invertible(we will talk more about it later).</p>

<p>Let’s talk about when there is more or less than one solution.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have three equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_1 - x_3 = b_1</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_2 - x_1 = b_2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_3 - x_2 = b_3</script>

<p>Now if <script type="math/tex">b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = 0</script>, then</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} x_1 - x_3 \\ x_2 - x_1 \\ x_3 - x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}</script> is solved by all vectors <script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} k \\ k \\ k \end{bmatrix}</script></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">k</script> is any constant.</p>

<p>Now if,say, <script type="math/tex">b_1 =1, b_2 =1 , b_3 =1</script>, then:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} x_1 - x_3 \\ x_2 - x_1 \\ x_3 - x_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</script> has no solution. Left side sums upto 0 and right side to 9.</p>

<p>But Let’s open the problem in the form <script type="math/tex">A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}</script>,</p>

<p>Now our question transforms into finding the linear combination of columns of <script type="math/tex">A</script> that is equal to <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<p>Now if we think about it geometrically, no combination of the columns will the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b} =(1,1,1)</script>. The combinations(of columns) don’t fill up the whole three-dimensional space but a plane given by <script type="math/tex">x + y + z =0</script></p>

<p>Here <script type="math/tex">A\mathbf{x}</script> represents all the linear combination of columns (for all values of <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{x}</script>, of course!). Now the sum of two vectors in same direction will have all its linear combinations in that direction. Similarly two vectors in different directions will have all their linear combinations in the plane defined by these two vectors. Now for three vectors, any two vectors will form a plane and if the third vector is not in that plane, then all three vectors are said to be <strong>independent</strong> and their linear combinations will fill up the whole three dimensional space. But if the third vector is a linear combination of the first two (i.e, it is in the same plane), then the vectors are said to be <strong>dependent</strong> and the third vector does not contribute anything new and so the result will be a plane.</p>

<p>Now in our matrix, the third column is a linear combination of the first two and hence the linear combination of these three vectors can only form a plane and we would have a solution if the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> was in that plane. And since the vector <script type="math/tex">(1,1,1)</script> is not in plane determined by the columns of the matrix, this equation has no solution. See Figure above.</p>

<p>If all this seems a bit too fast or shallow, don’t worry we will cover it in detail later.</p>

<h3 id="solving-linear-equations">Solving Linear Equations</h3>

<h4 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h4>

<p>Let’s just simply start with solving two equations with two variables. A two variable equation represents a line in a two dimensional space and all the points on that line satisfy that equation.</p>

<p>Now if we have two equations and we have to find solutions(s) that satisfy both these equations. Now based on the coefficients, a system of equations may have a unique solution, an infinite number of solution, or no solution.</p>

<p>We have a unique solution, if both the lines intersect at one point and that point is the solution to the system. We have infinite solutions when both lines run over each other. We have no solution if the lines don’t intersect at all(like parallel lines).</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of a unique solution case.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have two equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">4x - y = 9 \\ 3x + 2y = 4</script>

<p>The first equation <script type="math/tex">4x-y=9</script> produces a straight line in the <script type="math/tex">xy</script> plane. There are infinite points on it but a special point <script type="math/tex">(2,-1)</script> also satisfies it and is on the line.</p>

<p>The line by second equation <script type="math/tex">3x + 2y =4</script> is another line that also passes through <script type="math/tex">(2, -1)</script> and so the solution is <script type="math/tex">x=2</script> and <script type="math/tex">y=-1</script>.</p>

<p>This was the <em>row picture</em>. Let’s look at the column picture.</p>

<p>We will recognize the same system as a vector system. Instead of using numbers, we will use vectors. It can be shown as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x\begin{bmatrix}4 \\3 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix}-1 \\2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}9 \\4 \end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>Now the same problem has transformed into “find the combination of those two vectors that equals the vector on the right. Choosing <script type="math/tex">x=2</script> and <script type="math/tex">y=-1</script> (same as before!), we will get the right result.</p>

<p>Let’s see how the column picture reveals the answer. Let’s draw each vector, then the vector multipied and the vector on the right.</p>

<p>Here you can see the combination of these vectors lead to the final vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\3 \end{bmatrix} -1\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 9 \\4 \end{bmatrix}</script>

<p>By the simple look of the eye the row picture looks better than the column picture. It’s all in your right to choose, but I think it is easier to see a combinaton of four vectors in four dimensional space, than to visualize four hyper-planes meeting at a point.</p>

<p>Same problem, different pictures, same solutions. We combine the problem into a matrix problem as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A\mathbf{x}= \mathbf{b}\\ \implies \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 3 & 2\ \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 9 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>The matrix,  <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & -1 \\ 3 & 2\ \end{bmatrix} %]]></script> is called the <strong>coefficient matrix</strong>. Its rows give the row picture and its columns give you the column picture. And we can try it in julia like.</p>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">[</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="x">;</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="x">]</span>

<p>And it has given the same result as the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<p>In  three-equations-three-variables, the row picture will be that every equation will repersent a plane in the 3-D world and the solution will be all the intersecting points of these planes.</p>

<p>The column picture is three vectors (the vector of coefficients of <script type="math/tex">x</script> in all the equations, the vector of coefficients of <script type="math/tex">y</script> and that of <script type="math/tex">z</script>) lying in a 3-D space and their combination resulting in the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<p>The matrix form represents these both pictures.</p>

<h4 id="elimination">Elimination</h4>

<p>Until now, we just guessed the right answer to a system of equations and just verified the solution. But let’s now try to actually find the solution to a linear system.</p>

<p>Let’s start with 2 variables and 2 equations and return back to the system example we used before.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">4x - y = 9 \\ 3x + 2y = 4</script>

<p>Now, let’s see we can get the answer <script type="math/tex">(x,y) = (2,-1)</script>.</p>

<p>This equation is pretty easy to solve. I’m sure you can do as well.</p>

<p>I would like to eliminate the <script type="math/tex">x</script>-part of the second equation in the system. So, I multiply the first equation by <script type="math/tex">\frac{3}{4}</script> and then subtract it from the second equation.</p>

<p>Resulting,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}4x &- y = 9 \\ &\frac{11}{3}y = \frac{-11}{3}\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>The new equation gives <script type="math/tex">y = -1</script>, quickly and substituting that in the first equation we get <script type="math/tex">x=2</script>.</p>

<p>That was simple and you have done it tons of times. But I would like to introduce some terms here and maybe even formalize this procedure.</p>

<p>We used the the coefficient of <script type="math/tex">x</script> in the first equation to eliminate the first term in the second equation. This is called a <strong>pivot</strong> and the variable associated with it (here, <script type="math/tex">x</script>) is called a <strong>pivot variable</strong>.</p>

<p>The pivot can never be zero, as we cannot eliminate a non zero coefficient by it. No matter what we multiply it by we will always get a zero and that subtracted from other equation will not change them at all.</p>

<p>The resulting system was in a <em>“upper triangular form”</em> (if we align the variables). The pivots always lie on the diagonal of this traingular form after completed elimination.</p>

<p>We have a few more terminology to introduce. But let’s look at a few 
more cases of this system. The solution we got before was simple as the solution was unique.</p>

<p>But if solution isn’t unique, two cases arise: No solution and infinite solutions.</p>

<p>Let’s say the system is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">3x + 4y = 7 \\ 6x + 8y = 3</script>

<p>Let’s do the simple elimination again. Multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract from the second one to get the triangluar form:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}3x + &4y = 7 \\  &0y = -11\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>There is no solution <script type="math/tex">0y=-11</script>. Usually we would divide -11 by second pivot, but here is no second pivot(Zeros are not pivots!) making it a no solution system. In the row form it is represented by two parallel lines. The column picture shows that the vector <script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\6 \end{bmatrix}</script> and the vector <script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\8 \end{bmatrix}</script> are in the same direction. And so all it’s linear combinations will be restricted on a line along that direction. And the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\3 \end{bmatrix}</script> does not lie on that line and so no combination can do it. Hence no solution.</p>

<p>For the infinite soution let’s just change the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> to a vector which is on that line, say <script type="math/tex">\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\2 \end{bmatrix}</script>.</p>

<p>So the equations are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">3x + 4y = 1 \\ 6x + 8y = 2</script>

<p>Eliminating…, we get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}3x + &4y = 7 \\  &0y = 0\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Every <script type="math/tex">y</script> satisfies <script type="math/tex">0y=0</script>. The <script type="math/tex">y</script> is said to be a <strong>“free variable</strong>”, i.e we can choose <script type="math/tex">y</script> freely and <script type="math/tex">x</script> is then computed using the first equation. There is actually just one equation <script type="math/tex">3x + 4y =7</script>. This also has just one pivot.</p>

<p>In the row picture, both lines are the same. In the column picture the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}</script> lies on the line determined by the coefficient vectors. In fact it is one-third times the first column and it can also be defined as one-fourth times the second column and hence we can have an infinte combinations of these vectors that can end up on that vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<p>Sometimes we may have to exchange rows. It is because we want to have that traingular form, there might occur a Zero where there should be a pivot and we can exchange that row with the nearest row below which has a non-zero number at that place. e.g, a system is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0x + 3y = 9 \\ 3x + 4y = 0</script>

<p>Here we have a Zero where there should be a pivot in the first row. So we cannot perform elimination. But we can exchange it with the row below to get a pivot at that place and proceed with elimination.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}3x + &4y = 0 \\  &3y = 9\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Now this form is already in the trianglular form and can be back-substituted. So,
<script type="math/tex">y=3</script> from equation 2 and so <script type="math/tex">x = -4</script> from the first.</p>

<p>To understand Gaussian elimination, we need to go beyond 2-equations and two variables. Let’s try a 3-equation and 3-variable system.</p>

<p>Let’s say a system is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}\mathbf{2}&x + 4y - 6z = -2 \\ 4&x+3y-8z = 0 \\ -2&x + 6 y + 7z =3\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>The first pivot is in the bold-face. Now as we have to make it traingular, we will have to eliminate all the <script type="math/tex">x</script> terms in the second and third equation.</p>

<p>So subtracting <script type="math/tex">2</script> times the first equation from second and <script type="math/tex">-1</script> times the first equation from third.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}2x + 4y - 6z &= -2 \\ \mathbf{-5}y+4z &= 4 \\  10y + z &=1\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>Now the second pivot is shown in bold-face. We need to eliminate the <script type="math/tex">y</script> term in the third equation with it. So subtracting <script type="math/tex">-2</script> times the second equation from the third,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}2x + 4y - 6z &= -2 \\ -5y+4z &= 4 \\   \mathbf{9}z &=9\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>The third pivot is in bold-face. We have finished the forward pass of the Elimination. The pivots are 2,-5,9. The last two pivots were hidden in original system but elimination revealed them. Now it is ready for back substitution and</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">z = 1</script> and so <script type="math/tex">y = 0</script> and finally <script type="math/tex">x = 2</script>.</p>

<p>The row picture has three planes which meet at one point <script type="math/tex">(2,0,1)</script>.</p>

<p>The column picture has three vectors in the 3d space whose specific combination <script type="math/tex">2\mathbf{v_1} + 0 \mathbf{v_2} + 1 \mathbf{v_3}</script> produce the vector <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>, the output vector.</p>

<p>So the process of elimination can be summarized as, for any n by n problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Use first equation* to create zeroes below the first pivot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the second equation* to create zeroes below the second pivot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep going untill you get an triangular form or all the equations below have Zero coefficients.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*Do row exhanges wherever necessary, as Zero cannot be a pivot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you get a complete triangular form, then back substitution will reveal the unique solution. If you get all the coefficients to be Zero then if the cooresponding output is also zero, you have infinite solution, and if the corresponding output is not zero then there is no solution.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="matrix-multiplication">Matrix Multiplication</h4>

<p>Before talking about further elimination, let’s talk about matrix multiplication a bit more.</p>

<p>Let’s say we multiply a matrix and a column vector. The result will be another column vector., e.g:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\\ 3\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>This multiplication, by the simple formula of multiplying rows and columns and sum upto get one element of the resultant matrix, gives us the result:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\\ 3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} (2)(1) + (4)(2) + (-1)(3) \\ (1)(1) + (0)(2) + (2)(3) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Although this multiplication can also be represented as a linear combination of columns of the matrix using the elements of the vector:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2\\ 3\end{bmatrix} = 1 \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} + 2 \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + 3 \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} =  \begin{bmatrix} 7 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Similarly if we multiply two matrices, each column of the resultant matrix will be a linear combination of columns of <strong>left matrix</strong> using the elements of the corresponding <strong>column</strong> of <strong>right matrix</strong> as multipliers. If it seems too much, let’s see an example:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5\\ 3 & 6\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}7 & 22\\ 7 & 16 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>It can broken into two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The left matrix multiplying the <strong>first column</strong> of the right matrix to give the <strong>first column</strong> of the resultant matrix.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The left matrix multiplying the <strong>second column</strong> of the right matrix to give the <strong>second column</strong> of the resultant matrix.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So in the above example the <mark style="background-color: cyan;">first column</mark> of the resultant matrix is the first column plus twice the second column plus three times the third column of the left matrix,i.e a linear combination of columns of left matrix with the multipliers being the elements of the <mark style="background-color: cyan;">first column</mark> of right matrix.</p>

<p>Similarly we can see the <mark style="background-color: yellow;">second</mark> <mark style="background-color: lightgreen;">column</mark> of the resultant matrix again being the linear combination of <mark style="background-color: lightgreen;">columns</mark> of the left matrix with the numbers of the <mark style="background-color: yellow;">second</mark> <mark style="background-color: lightgreen;">column</mark> of the right matrix as multipliers.</p>

<p>Again if we multiply a row vector and a matrix,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5\\ 3 & 6\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>The result will be a row vector which will be linear combination of <strong>rows</strong> of the matrix with multipliers being elements of the row vector.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 4 \\ 2 & 5\\ 3 & 6\end{bmatrix} = 2 \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 4 \end{bmatrix} + 4 \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 5 \end{bmatrix} + (-1) \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 & 22 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Similarly, if we multiply two matrices we can show that each row is a linear combination of rows of the <strong>right</strong> matrix with elements from the corresponding <strong>row</strong> of the <strong>left</strong> matrix are the multipliers.</p>

<p>So a matrix multiplication can be shown as linear combination of rows(of the right matrix) as well as a linear combination of columns(of the left matrix).</p>

<p>We will put the above facts, particularly about the row combination to our use to perform subtraction of equations and hence elimination.</p>

<h4 id="elimination-using-matrices">Elimination Using Matrices</h4>

<p>Let’s use the system again we used before for this,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align}2&x + 4y - 6z = -2 \\ 4&x+3y-8z = 0 \\ -2&x + 6 y + 7z =3\end{align} %]]></script>

<p>This system can be conveniently changed into,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{2} & 4 & -6 \\ 4 & 3 & -8 \\ -2 & 6 & 7\end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ 0 \\3 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>and so can be also written as <script type="math/tex">A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}</script></p>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">[</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="x">;</span>
     <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="x">;</span>
    <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">6</span>  <span class="mi">7</span><span class="x">]</span>

<span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="x">;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="x">;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="x">];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, to perform first step of elimination, we have to remove the elements below the first pivot (bold face) using row subtractions. Now whatever row changes we make in <script type="math/tex">A</script>, we have to make in <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> as well.</p>

<p>We have to subtract 2 times the first row from the second and -1 times the first row from the third. To perform this operation, I will multiply both sides by a matrix <script type="math/tex">E_1</script>.</p>

<p>I would say the matrix <script type="math/tex">E_1</script> is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_1 = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">E1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="x">;</span>
     <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
      <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="x">];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This matrix, when pre-multiplied, will always perform the above operation on any matrix(which is compatible for matrix multiplication, of course!). Let’s see why.</p>

<p>Let’s think of the resultant matrix. The first row of that matrix will be a combination of the rows of the right matrix (on which the operation is being done on) with the first row of <script type="math/tex">E_1</script> being the multipliers.</p>

<p>First row of resultant matrix: <script type="math/tex">1 \times \text{row1}</script> (of original matrix) + <script type="math/tex">0 \times \text{row2} + 0 \times \text{row3} = \text{row1}</script></p>

<p>So the first row is not changed.</p>

<p>Similarly second row of resultant matrix: <script type="math/tex">-2 \times \text{row1} + 1 \times \text{row2} + 0 \times \text{row3} = \text{row2} - (2)\ \text{row1}</script></p>

<p>So we have subtracted twice row 1 from row 2.</p>

<p>Third row of resultant matrix: <script type="math/tex">1 \times \text{row1} + 0 \times \text{row2} + 1 \times \text{row3} = \text{row3} - (-1)\text{row1}</script></p>

<p>So we have subtracted -1 times row 1 from row 3.</p>

<p>Let’s now perform <script type="math/tex">E_1A</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_1\mathbf{b}</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_1A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 4 & 3 & -8 \\ -2 & 6 & 7\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 10 & 1\end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>So now our equation is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_1A\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 0 & \mathbf{-5} & 4 \\ 0 & 10 & 1\end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y\\z\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 4\\ 1\end{bmatrix} = E_1\mathbf{b} %]]></script>

<p>The second pivot(bold face) has to remove the elements below it. Now we have to subtract -2 times row from row 3. We will make another Elimination matrix, <script type="math/tex">E2</script> to perform this operation. But let’s now make it row by row so we understand how it works.</p>

<p>So in the row1 resultant matrix, we do not want any change in the matrix.</p>

<p>hence row1 of elimination matrix = <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} %]]></script> i.e we want 1 of the first row and none of any other row, giving us the original row back.</p>

<p>In row2 of resultant matrix we again do not want any change,</p>

<p>so row2 of elimination matrix = <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0\end{bmatrix} %]]></script> i.e we want 1 of second row and none of any other row.</p>

<p>Now in row3 we want to eliminate 10 using pivot -5, so we want to subtract -2 times the row 2 from row 3 which is also adding 2 times row 2 to row 3:</p>

<p>so row3 of elimination matrix = <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 & 1\end{bmatrix} %]]></script> i.e we want twice of row2 and row 1, which will eliminate the required numbers.</p>

<p>So the final elimination matrix will be:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">E2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="x">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="x">;</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="x">;</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="x">];</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So let’s now perform <script type="math/tex">E_2(E_1A)</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_2(E_1\mathbf{b})</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_2(E_1A) =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\ \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 10 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 9 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3×3 Array{Int64,2}:

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3-element Array{Int64,1}:

  9
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now the equation is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_2(E_1A)\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & -6 \\ 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 9 \end{bmatrix} \ \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 4 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix} = E_2(E_1\mathbf{b}) %]]></script>

<p>Here we have reached to the upper triangular form and hence have completed the forward pass. the backward pass is simple.</p>

<p>So we apply elimination matrices to change <script type="math/tex">A \rightarrow U</script>, where <script type="math/tex">U</script> is an upper traingular matrix. We apply the same matrices to change <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b} \rightarrow \mathbf{b}'</script> and finally solve <script type="math/tex">U\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b'}</script> using back-substitution(if there is a unique solution).</p>

<p>One more thing to mention about matrix multiplication is that it holds on associativity. So, if <script type="math/tex">P, Q, R</script> are three matrices(compatible for matrix multiplication in the order), then:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(QR) = (PQ)R</script>

<p>So basically we can multiply all our elimination matrices first, and then multiply that with our <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E = E_nE_{n-1}\cdots E_2E_1</script>

<p>Let’s see how this matrix <script type="math/tex">E</script> looks like in our example.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E = E_2E_1  = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \ \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\ \mathbf{-3} & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>So we multiply by this elimination matrix to our matrix <script type="math/tex">A</script> to form an Upper triangular matrix, <script type="math/tex">U</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E_2(E_1A) = (E_2E_1)A = EA = U</script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">E_2(E_1\mathbf{b}) = (E_2E_1)\mathbf{b} = E\mathbf{b} =\mathbf{b'}</script>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">E</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">E2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">E1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3×3 Array{Int64,2}:
  1  0  0
 -2  1  0
 -3  2  1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the matrix <script type="math/tex">E</script> has almost all the same multipliers that we use in individual except a few(shown in bold-face of matrix <script type="math/tex">E</script>). It is because the effect of the first elimination is shown in second and so on. In our example the second row is subtracted by <strong>2</strong> times the first row and the third row is  added by <strong>1</strong> times first row. Then the <em>new</em> third row is added <strong>2</strong> times the <em>new</em> second row. So essentially, the <em>original</em> third row was subtracted <strong>3</strong> times the first row and <strong>2</strong> times the original second row.</p>

<p>However to show it in a better way, we can use the inverse of <script type="math/tex">E</script>,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">EA = U</script> can be shown as <script type="math/tex">A = E^{-1}U</script></p>

<p>Let’s look at <script type="math/tex">E^{-1}</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & -2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<div class="language-julia highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">L</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">inv</span><span class="x">(</span><span class="n">E</span><span class="x">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>3×3 Array{Float64,2}:
  1.0   0.0  0.0
  2.0   1.0  0.0
 -1.0  -2.0  1.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <script type="math/tex">E^{-1}</script> has the correct values that mutiply the pivots, before <strong>subtracting</strong> them from the lower rows going from <script type="math/tex">A</script> to <script type="math/tex">U</script>. SInce it is an lower traingular matrix, we represent it by <script type="math/tex">L</script>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A = LU</script>

<p>The matrix <script type="math/tex">L</script> can be used at many places.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It can be used to factorize <script type="math/tex">A</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has the memory of pivot multipliers before subtraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>*It can be used to compute transformed right hand side,<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b'}</script>, as <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b} = L\mathbf{b'}</script>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>*Although we can also concatenate <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">\mathbf{b}</script> as <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\begin{bmatrix} A & \mathbf{b} \end{bmatrix} %]]></script> and then run it though the forward elimination but most applications tend to do them separately.</p>

<h4 id="row-exchanges">Row Exchanges</h4>

<p>Here we had prepared everything but considering no row exchange will be needed. Let’s remind that row exchanges are needed when zeros occur at pivot places.</p>

<p>What matrix to use when we have to exchange two rows? Let’s take an example:
end{bmatrix}
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{1} & 3 & 5 \\ 3 & 9 & 7 \\ 4 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix} %]]></script></p>

<p>Let’s first eliminate the first column using the first pivot(bold-face),</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
E_1A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\ -3 & 1 & 0 \\ -4 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \ \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{1} & 3 & 5 \\ 3 & 9 & 7 \\ 4 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & -8 \\ 0 & -4 & -11 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>As you can see the second diagonal element is zero, which cannot be a pivot. So we will exchange the second and third row. the matrix we will apply is called a <em>permutation matrix</em>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
P_{23} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>So the first resultant row will be the same. The resultant second row will be zero times first and second row and 1 times third row ,i.e the third row. The resultant third row will be zero times first and third row but 1 times the second, i.e the second row. So, essentially the second and the third row have been exchanged. A permutation matrix is basically identity matrix with the same rows exchanged which need to be changed in the coefficient matrix.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
P_{23}(E_1A) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & -8 \\ 0 & -4 & -11 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 & 5 \\ 0 & \mathbf{-4} & -11 \\ 0 & 0 & -8  \end{bmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Now we have the new pivot and we can move with elimination.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Row exchanges will alter the final the elimination matrix, <script type="math/tex">E</script> as well as the inverse <script type="math/tex">L</script> which will not have the values at the same place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now one way to keep it in the same way is if we perform all the row exchanges first, using the product of all permutation matrices, <script type="math/tex">P</script> and then perform the elimination using <script type="math/tex">E</script>.</p>

<p>Final equation is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">PA = LU</script>

<p>This is a good stopping point in basics. We will next see what does the infinite solutions mean, how we represent them. What are vector spaces and subspaces, rank, invertibility and more.</p>
